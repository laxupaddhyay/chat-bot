Project Description: AWS is a widely used cloud Platform and It has also one of the 
Largest market share in the cloud Industry. Many companies are using AWS cloud services to deliver their services efficiently and many of them are using for Website hosting. Using AWS services company can lower the cost with no upfront expenses.
 
This project is an integration of Full Stack Web Development in MERN with Cloud.
This “Cloud Resource management tool ” is a web application that can be used to manage Instances services like- EC2 etc.
 
This web app Provides the facility for users to create Instances of their desired operating system without having any knowledge of EC2 instances. After their instance launch they can run various commands into the instance using our web app.

Technologies Used:

Cloud service Provider : Amazon Web services
AWS is the current market leader in the cloud Industry. AWS provides various cloud services like EC2 for instances, EBS for storage, S3 for object storage, VPC for private cloud and many more.

Web Development Tools:
ØFront-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
HTML, the language that gives web content structure and meaning
CSS, the language used to style web pages
JavaScript, the scripting language used to create dynamic functionality on the web
 
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime 
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
 
ØCloud Platform for hosting the website: AWS (Amazon Web Services) EC2 :
We are using AWS EC2 for the Website hosting and on top of this only our instance will be launched into the AWS account. EC2 is a good service to get the Virtual machine with high Availability and Scalability on AWS cloud.

Conclusion : 

We have created the application for Various usage where user will just have to register themselves and after that for every single user the dashboard will be different. Every user can see and view their instances and Connect to them using the instance ID. After that they can run multiple linux commands.



Future Scope:

Many features can be added to this webapp as it grows in future:
ØKubernetes tool to be added.
ØUnable to view all due to the privacy policy which is to be bypassed further.
ØAdding some voice enabled functions to make even more better.
ØTrying to add live terminal interpreter as like shell.
ØDeploying this project as an app for further things.
